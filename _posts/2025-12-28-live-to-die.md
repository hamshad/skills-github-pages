I was watching Jeff Buckley Reel on Grace. His speaking had grace, his music had grace. Yet he died so young. I think, he understood living. Understood to live, love and life. That's why death was deserving to him. I think death is grace. It's a promised grace. Everyone will be rewarded with this grace. Yet my some are get them deservingly as they understood life.
